TypeScript - Theory Reference Document

#1 Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript developed and maintained by Microsoft.

It adds optional static types and modern features to JavaScript.

TypeScript code compiles (or transcompiles) to standard JavaScript, enabling cross-platform compatibility.

#2 Key Features

Static Typing: Type annotations help catch errors during development.

Type Inference: Automatically infers types when not explicitly declared.

Modern JavaScript: Supports ES6+ features and future proposals.

Enhanced IDE Support: Better autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring.

Compatibility: Works with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks.

#3 Type System

Basic Types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint.

Complex Types: arrays, tuples, enums.

Custom Types: interfaces, type aliases, union and intersection types.

Advanced Types: generics, literal types, mapped types, conditional types.

#4 TypeScript Compilation

TypeScript uses the tsc (TypeScript compiler) to convert .ts files into .js files.

A tsconfig.json file defines compiler options and project structure.

#5 Interfaces and Types

Interfaces: Define contracts for objects and classes.

Type Aliases: Create custom type definitions using type keyword.

Supports extension and merging.

#6 Classes and OOP

TypeScript supports full object-oriented programming:

Classes, Constructors

Inheritance

Access modifiers (public, private, protected)

Abstract classes and interfaces

#7 Modules and Namespaces

Modular code using import and export.

Supports CommonJS, AMD, and ES Modules.

Namespaces used for grouping logically related code (less common in modern TS).

#8 Functions and Generics

Function types, optional and default parameters.

Generic functions and interfaces for reusability and type safety.

#9 Decorators (Experimental)

Special syntax for annotating and modifying classes and members.

Common in frameworks like Angular.

#10 Type Checking and Safety

TypeScript performs compile-time checking.

Helps identify bugs early and improves maintainability.

Strict mode enhances type safety with settings like strictNullChecks, noImplicitAny.

#11 Tooling and Ecosystem

TypeScript works with most editors (e.g., VS Code).

Strong ecosystem with integrations for frameworks like Angular, React, and Node.js.

Tools: ESLint, Prettier, Webpack, Babel, etc.

#12 Use Cases

Large-scale applications with complex logic.

Teams requiring clear contracts and type safety.

Applications where maintainability and scalability are priorities.

This TypeScript theory reference provides an overview of key concepts and features. It's designed to support learning and review without diving into syntax or code samples.
